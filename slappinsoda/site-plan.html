      <p>
        Welcome to Slappin Soda, the best soda place around. We have seen soda shops around and have often got lost with what they actually offer.
        Unclean menus and not a strong purpose. Here at Slappin Soda we want to change that and be a step above the rest.
        You may be wondering how we accomplish that. To start will be with our website.
        This will have our purpose on the home page. Then we will have a clear menu showing all the sodas we offer with all the different combinations.
        Finding what you want at our shop has never been easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        When customers come to our website we will expect them to have questions. What is Slapping Soda? Why is Slappin Soda a thing?
        What can I get at Slappin Soda? How can I get in contact with Slappin Soda? Our website plans on answering all of those questions by having a main page showing what we are.
        Having a menu showing exactly what we offer. And having a contact page that shows how to contact us, how to support us, and a little about the owners.

      <h3>Menu</h3>
      <p>
        Why is our menu so important? Recently while attending a local shop I went online first to get a look at their menu.
        In doing so the menu was very hard to read and figuring out exactly what they offered was difficult. So by the time I pulled up to the drive thru I had no idea what to get.
        I figured this was something that I could do better. So that is why we are shooting to have a good menu. So when you visit you can find exactly what you want without the hassle of trying to navigate through a hard website
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to complete this we need to know exactly what we want on our menu. Will we have a big menu or a smaller menu? What should our options be? What is the name of those options?
        All the answers to these will help us make a good menu that is very clear for the customer to read. We will also need to figure out what kind of style of menu we want. What is going to make this menu clear and concise?
