                <p id="speech1">Welcome to Slappin Soda, the best soda place around. We have seen soda shops around and have often got lost with what they actually offer.
                    Unclean menus and not a strong purpose. Here at Slappin Soda we want to change that and be a step above the rest.
                    You may be wondering how we accomplish that. To start will be with our website. This will have our purpose on the home page.
                    Then we will have a clear menu showing all the sodas we offer with all the different combinations.
                    Finding what you want at our shop has never been easier.

                    When customers come to our website we will expect them to have questions. What is Slapping Soda? Why is Slappin Soda a thing?
                    What can I get at Slappin Soda? How can I get in contact with Slappin Soda? Our website plans on answering all of those questions by having a main page showing what we are.
                    Having a menu showing exactly what we offer. And having a contact page that shows how to contact us, how to support us, and a little about the owners.
