        Hi my name is Payton. I currently work as a Quality Assurance Engineer. On the side I am studying Applied Technology. 
        I love the problem solving aspect of this career path. Being able to solve a new problem everyday is something I enjoy. 
        Then when our final product is done it is so satisfying.

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ for 14 years. A scripture that has been on my mind recently is 2 Nephi 4:34 
        “ 34 ​O Lord, I have ​​​trusted​ in thee, and I will ​​​trust​ in thee forever. I will not put my ​​​trust​ in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his ​​​trust​ in the arm of flesh.
        Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.”
